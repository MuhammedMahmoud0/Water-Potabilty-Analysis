# 💧 Water Potability Analysis
📜 Overview

This project analyzes the quality of water to determine its potability (suitability for drinking) using machine learning models. It also includes a simple web application for users to interact with the results.
🚀 Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and feature engineering.

    Machine Learning Models:

        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

        Support Vector Machine (SVM)

        Decision Tree

        Naive Bayes

    Model Evaluation: Compared different models to identify the best-performing one.

    Web Application: Built with Flask and HTML/CSS for easy interaction.

    Database Integration: MongoDB used to store and retrieve model results and predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

    Flask (for backend API and server)

    MongoDB (for database storage)

    HTML & CSS (for frontend interface)

📈 Machine Learning Workflow

    Data Cleaning (Handling missing values using KNN Imputer)

    Feature Engineering

    Feature Scaling

    Model Training & Testing

    Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

    Selection of Best Model

    Deployment via Flask Web App
